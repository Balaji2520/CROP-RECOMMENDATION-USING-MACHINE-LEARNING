Crop recommendation using machine learning techniques is a rapidly growing field in agriculture. The goal is to use data-driven approaches to help farmers make informed decisions about what crops to plant and how to optimize their crop yields. In this process, large amounts of data are collected on factors such as soil type, climate, topography, and previous crop yields. This data is then analyzed using various machine learning algorithms to create predictive models that can suggest which crops are most likely to thrive in a given area.

       One approach is to use random forest, which are a type of algorithm that can be used to identify the most important factors that influence crop yield. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN) & Naive Bayes and Random forests, to analyze the data and generate recommendations. With the help of machine learning techniques, farmers can make more accurate and informed decisions about which crops to plant, which fertilizers to use, and how to manage pests and diseases. We recommend crops with a high level of precision and recall, and outperformed traditional methods of crop recommendation. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to improve crop production and sustainability.
